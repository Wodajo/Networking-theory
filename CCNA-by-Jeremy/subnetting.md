you kinda understand it

FLSM (fixed length subnet masks) - divide network into same-sized subnets
VLSM (variable length subnet masks) - start with the biggest subnet, than gradually smaller ones

there are exercises where you have to calculate max. nr. of valid subnets - usually you have to **assume classfull subnetting**
	e.g.  in 10.23.161.167/11 subnet of class A network - there are 2^n subnets
	where n - borrowed subnet bits
